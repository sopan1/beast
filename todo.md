# BeastBrowser Anti-Detection Full Spoof Integration

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created `preload-full-spoof.js` with comprehensive spoofing for timezone, navigator properties, WebRTC, Intl, Date, plugins, mimeTypes, and permissions.
- [x] Updated `main.js` to use `preload-full-spoof.js` for all BrowserWindow and profile windows.
- [x] Enhanced `main.js` to send comprehensive spoof data (timezone, userAgent, acceptLanguage, platform, appName, appVersion) to preload via IPC.
- [x] Added webRequest header overrides in `main.js` to set consistent `Accept-Language` and `User-Agent` headers for HTTP/HTTPS and SOCKS proxies.
- [x] Verified no duplicate or redundant code lines introduced during edits.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test full spoof integration in development mode.
- [ ] Test full spoof integration in packaged build.
- [ ] Verify spoofed navigator properties and timezone in browser context.
- [ ] Verify WebRTC local IP leaks are blocked.
- [ ] Verify Accept-Language and User-Agent headers match spoofed values.
- [ ] Test proxy setups (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5) with spoofing applied.
- [ ] Confirm no console errors or warnings related to spoofing.
- [ ] Validate fingerprint spoofing script execution in profile windows.

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` matches spoofed timezone.
- [ ] `navigator.language`, `navigator.languages`, `navigator.userAgent`, `navigator.platform` spoofed correctly.
- [ ] `navigator.webdriver` is false.
- [ ] WebRTC SDP and ICE candidates do not leak local IPs.
- [ ] Network requests have spoofed `Accept-Language` and `User-Agent` headers.
- [ ] Profile windows load with spoofing applied on `did-start-loading`.
- [ ] Proxy geo data is used for timezone and locale spoofing.
- [ ] No errors in Electron main or renderer console related to spoofing.

## Notes
- The preload script is defensive and swallows errors to avoid breaking pages.
- Spoofing data is sent from main process after proxy geo data is obtained.
- Headers are overridden at session level for consistency.
- WebRTC override scrubs IPs from SDP and ICE candidates.
- Plugins and mimeTypes are stubbed to avoid empty arrays.
- Permissions API is patched to avoid webdriver detection.
